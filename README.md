### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Karim Zamrini. I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer - Thank you for stopping by!
Since I was a child, my brain has always wanted to know more, and understand the world around me better. What started as building LEGOs turned into building computers. I've always had a passion for learning, and advancing to the next step. 

This passion has now lead me down the path of software engineering: Learning to understand and build useful, interesting, and modular applications.

#### I'm currently learning full-stack web development at Hack Reactor, with a focus on:
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- React.js
